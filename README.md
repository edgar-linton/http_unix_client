---

**`unix_http_client`** is an asynchronous HTTP client for communicating with local HTTP servers over Unix domain sockets.  
Inspired by the [`reqwest`] API, but tailored for inter-process communication (IPC) on Unix-based systems.

> ðŸŒ€ **Currently async-only** â€” blocking support like `reqwest::blocking` is not yet implemented.

---

## ðŸš€ Example

```rust,no_run
use unix_http_client::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = Client::new();
    let response = client
        .get("/tmp/my.socket", "/health")
        .send()
        .await?;

    println!("Status: {}", response.status());
    Ok(())
}
```
